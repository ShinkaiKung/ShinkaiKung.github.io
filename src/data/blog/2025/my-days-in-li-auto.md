## The First Day

I can still **picture** it clearly—my very first day at Li Auto. Beijing was in early spring, the kind where the air still bites at your face and the wind slices through your coat. I woke up early, a mix of excitement and nerves already **humming in my chest**. The headquarters was **all the way out in the suburbs**, at least an hour and a half from where I lived.

The commute felt like a small journey of its own. First the subway, **rattling along with** the morning crowd, then a transfer to a bus that was **just as packed**. From where I stood, all I could see were shoulders and backpacks; the view outside was completely hidden. I kept worrying I might miss my stop. At one point, I **rose on my toes** to **catch a glimpse** of the route, but before I could, a man beside me said with a **half-smile**, “No hurry—this whole bus is Li Auto employees. It’s the next stop.” He was right. When the bus **pulled over**, the carriage emptied in seconds, and I found myself standing at the door as if I had been waiting for it all along.

At the company gate, I signed in and was shown to the largest meeting room in Building D. Only a few new hires had arrived. At 9 a.m. **sharp**, a lady stepped in and began explaining the rules, benefits, and the little quirks of life at the company. After that, I was given a Lark account. That’s when I first saw the name “Zhize”—my supervisor.

I hesitated before typing my first message to him. Just “Hello.” But I stared at his avatar for a long time, wondering—what kind of person is he? What if he’s like the nightmare bosses in all those office stories? My worry deepened when he asked me to apply for an Ubuntu 20.04 desktop computer. I’d never worked on Ubuntu, except courseworks at college. And here I was, about to start my first challenge before I’d even found my desk.

**By the time** I reached our office area, it was lunch break. I waited at the reception until Pengfei—my interviewer and the department head—came out to greet me. He was warm, quick to shake my hand, and soon introduced me to my mentor, Wei.

Wei was **strikingly** tall, with a quiet confidence about him. He had graduated from both Tsinghua and the University of Waterloo, and already had five years of experience **under his belt**. We chatted briefly before he introduced me to the rest of the team—Zhize, Junfei, Ruijie, Xiang…

Because desks were scarce, I was temporarily placed in another department’s area. It wasn’t ideal, but I didn’t mind. After all, the wheel had started turning—and my journey at Li Auto had truly begun.
